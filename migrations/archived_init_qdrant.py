ARCHIVED: Qdrant migration (kept for historical reference)
This project has migrated to using pgvector in Postgres instead of Qdrant.
If you previously used `migrations/init_qdrant.py`, it is retained here for reference but is not required for the pgvector-based workflow.
"""

# Original behavior was to create Qdrant collections. The project now uses Postgres+pgvector.

# If you really need to run Qdrant-related steps, refer to the original `migrations/init_qdrant.py` file.
